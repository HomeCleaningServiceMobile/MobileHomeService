```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
📁 Address Selection System
├── 🎯 AddressSelectionFragment.java - Main map interface
├── 📋 AddressSuggestionAdapter.java - Suggestions dropdown
├── ⚙️ MapboxConfig.java - Configuration & token management
├── 🎨 fragment_address_selection.xml - UI layout
├── 🔧 Updated CreateBookingFragment.java - Integration
├── 📊 Updated BookingViewModel.java - Data management
└── 📚 Documentation files
```

### Integration Points
```java
// BookingViewModel automatically receives:
bookingViewModel.setServiceAddress(address);      // "123 Main St, District 1, HCMC"
bookingViewModel.setAddressLatitude(latitude);    // 10.762622
bookingViewModel.setAddressLongitude(longitude);  // 106.660172
```

## 🔧 Implementation Highlights

### Address Autofill (Primary)
```java
// Optimized for address completion
Query query = Query.create(userInput);
addressAutofill.suggestions(query, options, callback);

// Returns structured data:
{
  "houseNumber": "123",
  "street": "Nguyen Hue Street",
  "locality": "District 1", 
  "place": "Ho Chi Minh City",
  "country": "Vietnam"
}
```

### Search Engine (Fallback)
```java
// General location search as backup
searchEngine.search(query, callback);
```

### Reverse Geocoding
```java
// Both Address Autofill and Search Engine support
addressAutofill.reverse(point, options, callback);
searchEngine.search(reverseGeoOptions, callback);
```

## 🎯 Why This Approach is Perfect
